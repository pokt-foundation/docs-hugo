      <description>Pocket Network is a pioneer in a new era of democratically-governed digital public goods. Our Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) means that you, our community, will control all aspects of our protocol and ecosystem.
Pocket uses off-chain governance because it‚Äôs the most flexible and future-proof way for us to organize our DAO. For more on our reasoning behind this, check out our Lean Governance Thesis.
To learn how to earn a vote in the DAO and decide the future of Pocket Network, see the section on trophies.</description>
