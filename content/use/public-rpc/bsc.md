  Endpoint
---


{% embed url="https://youtu.be/fLTvtBtOEg0" %}

We have created a public BSC RPC endpoint with up to 1M requests per day to give people who use Metamask the opportunity to connect to Pocket's decentralized, censorship-resistant infra.

To get started connecting to Pocket's infrastructure for BSC, do the following:

1. Click on the Networks drop-down menu, then press Custom RPC
2. Under the Network Name field, write **BSC Pocket Portal**
3. Within the New RPC URL field, copy and paste this endpoint URL`https://bsc-mainnet.gateway.pokt.network/v1/lb/6136201a7bad1500343e248d`
4. Put the decimal **56** in the ChainID field
5. Write **BNB** as the Symbol
6. Add `https://bscscan.com` as the Block Explorer URL
7. Donâ€™t forget to save
