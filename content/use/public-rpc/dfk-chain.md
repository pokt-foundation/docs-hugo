  Pocket RPC endpoint
---


For those who play [Defi Kingdoms](https://defikingdoms.com/), you can use Pocket's public RPC endpoint for DFK Chain and take advantage of Pocket's decentralized infrastructure.

There are two ways to connect your MetaMask wallet to DFK Chain. Choose whichever method you prefer.

## Chainlist

1. Navigate to [https://chainlist.org/?search=dfk](https://chainlist.org/?search=dfk), or go to [Chainlist](https://chainlist.org) and search for "dfk".
2. Click the down arrow under DFK Chain to expand the entry.
3. In the row with the URL that begins with `htps://avax-dfk.gateway.pokt.network...` click **Connect Wallet**. (You may need to scroll the window to the right to see this.)
4. Click **Add to MetaMask**.
5. When prompted, click **Approve** in the MetaMask interface.

## Add manually

1. In MetaMask, click the **Networks** drop-down menu, then select **Custom RPC**.
2. Under the **Network Name** field, type **DFK Chain POKT**.
3. Within the **New RPC URL** field, copy and paste this endpoint URL:
   * `https://avax-dfk.gateway.pokt.network/v1/lb/6244818c00b9f0003ad1b619//ext/bc/q2aTwKuyzgs8pynF7UXBZCU7DejbZbZ6EUyHr3JQzYgwNPUPi/rpc`
4. In the **ChainID** field, type **53935**.
5. For the **Symbol**, type **JEWEL**.
6. For the Block Explorer URL, add `https://subnets.avax.network/defi-kingdoms/dfk-chain/explorer`. 
7. Save changes.
