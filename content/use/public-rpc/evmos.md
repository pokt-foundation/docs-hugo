description: How to add the Evmos network in MetaMask with a Pocket-powered RPC Endpoint
---


We have minted a public Evmos RPC endpoint with up to XM requests per day to give people who use Metamask the opportunity to connect to Pocket's decentralized, censorship-resistant infra.

To get started connecting to Pocket's infrastructure for Evmos, do the following:

1. Click on the Networks drop-down menu, then press Custom RPC
2. Under the Network Name field, write **Evmos Pocket Portal**
3. Within the New RPC URL field, copy and paste this endpoint URL `https://evmos-testnet.gateway.pokt.network/v1/lb/61aabb3495d548003aebfd1c`
4. Put the decimal **9000** in the ChainID field
5. Write **PHOTON** as the Symbol
6. Add `https://evm.evmos.org/` as the Block Explorer URL
7. Donâ€™t forget to save
