1. Click on the gear icon to open the settings page
2. If it doesn't open automatically, click on "+" icon to expand the settings page
3. Scroll down until you see the "Change RPC Endpoint" section
4. Copy and paste this endpoint URL into the text box[`https://poa-xdai.gateway.pokt.network/v1/lb/60b13899d3279c22da2a444d`](https://poa-xdai.gateway.pokt.network/v1/lb/60b13899d3279c22da2a444d)``
5. Click "Change RPC URL" to Save
6. Make a move!
