Submitting proposals to the DAO is pretty easy and anyone can do it.

There are 3 types of proposals:

* **PIP: Pocket Improvement Proposal**
* **PEP: Pocket Ecosystem Proposal**
* **PUP: Pocket Update Proposal**

Posting your proposal to Discourse puts it up for consideration and debate by the DAO. To kickstart a vote, you need a voter to submit it to our [governance dashboard](https://gov.pokt.network) on your behalf.

## ðŸ¦¾ PIP  â€“ Pocket Improvement Proposal

**Pocket Improvement Proposals \(PIPs\)** include any proposals that aim to level up the Pocket Network ecosystem, through:

* Upgrading the Pocket Network protocol
* Upgrading the governance of the DAO and the Pocket Network Foundation
* Adding/removing permission holders within the existing governance structure of the DAO

PIP votes will last 7 days and pass with Majority Approval \(50% yes votes by participating voters\) unless otherwise specified in the [Constitution](https://github.com/pokt-foundation/governance/blob/master/constitution/constitution.md). 

To submit a PIP, head to the forum [here](https://forum.pokt.network/c/governance/pip/28), then click New Topic to generate a template for your proposal.


## ðŸ’° PEP â€“ Pocket Ecosystem Proposal

**Pocket Ecosystem Proposals \(PEPs\)** include proposals to distribute funds to or form agreements with Contributors to the Pocket Network ecosystem, in the form of:

* **Imbursements** â€“ payments for future work
* **Reimbursements** â€“ compensation for previous work
* **Bounties** â€“ rewards for work that donâ€™t yet have specified workers
* **Transfers** â€“ transferring funds between DAO-owned accounts
* **Agreements** â€“ forming new DAO relationships, including non-financial in nature

How is the DAO funded?

The DAO earns continuous revenue in the form of the [DAOAllocation](../../learn/protocol-parameters.md#daoallocation), which is a % that the DAO receives for every [RelaysToTokensMultiplier](../../learn/protocol-parameters.md#relaystotokensmultiplier) minted in the block reward. This is proportional to the number of relays being processed for app developers, which means the more traction Pocket Network gets, the more wealthy the DAO becomes!

PEP votes will last 7 days and pass with Majority Approval \(50% yes votes by participating voters\) unless otherwise specified in the [Constitution](https://github.com/pokt-foundation/governance/blob/master/constitution/constitution.md).
